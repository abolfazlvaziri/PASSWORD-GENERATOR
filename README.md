### PASSWORD GENERATOR
----
I can confidently say that if you choose a strong password, the possibility of accidentally giving your accounts, files and other information to others will decrease.

A strong password is a password that is as long as possible and consists of a combination of letters, numbers and special characters (such as *, : and %). It is also preferable that the words in the dictionaries are not used in it.

In this tool, based on your information, we create a random and strong password that you can use for Instagram, email, files, Wi-Fi, etc.!
